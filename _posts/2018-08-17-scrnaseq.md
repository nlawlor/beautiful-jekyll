## Gene expression at single cell resolution (single cell RNA-sequencing)

Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) has become a popular tool for capturing and profiling the gene expression patterns
(transcriptome) of individual cell types from heterogenous tissues (such as human pancreatic islets). 
With this technology, for example, we can investigate the transcriptomes of _thousands_ of individual pancreatic islet cells!

A common application of scRNAseq is characterizing the unique gene expression profiles of different cell types. 
Below is an example of scRNAseq data (from human pancreatic islets) reduced to 3 dimensions, highlighting the
differences between the different cell types (each point color represents a different cell type):

## Using scRNAseq to classify pancreatic islet cell types

With scRNAseq, we have determined there to be at least 4 different pancreatic islet cell types: **beta** (red),
**alpha** (blue), **delta** (green), and **gamma/PP** (purple), each with very distinct transcriptome profiles
(**Panels A and B** in the figure below). A closer look in **Panel C** shows that each different cell type demonstrates
robust and unique expression for specific genes (e.g., _INS_ expression is highest in beta (red) cells).
