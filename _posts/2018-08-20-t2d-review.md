## Type 2 diabetes: A complex metabolic disorder

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a multi-tissue metabolic disorder that results when pancreatic islets
fail to compensate for insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. Recent genomics research examining 
the chromatin architecture and gene expression programs of human islets have implicated several different
genetic, environmental, and cellular mechanisms that may be contributing to islet failure and ultimately T2D pathogenesis.

## An overview of potential cellular mechanisms contributing to T2D

In recent years, several studies have used single cell RNA-seq to profile and define the gene expression programs of the different
cell types that comprise islets (check out my other post here)[https://nlawlor.github.io/2018-08-17-scrnaseq/].
In addition, by comparing gene expression profiles between these cell types in individuals with and without T2D, these studies
have highlighted specific alterations in islet cell type transcriptomes may underlie 
T2D pathogenesis (see **Figure 3A** below). 

However, there's more! Reserachers have also suggested that changes in actual cell proportions (**Figure 3B**),
identity, and plasticity (Figure 3C, 3D) may be contributing to T2D. In patients with T2D, it is common to observe
a decline in the total beta cell mass. Overall, this decrease in beta cell number means the patient with T2D is unable
to produce insulin to counteract their rising blood glucose levels.
However, what causes this reduction in beta cell number is still somewhat unclear.
Researchers are now suggesting that the decreases in diabetic beta cell mass
are caused by reversion to endocrine progenitor (hormone-negative) cells (**Figure 3C**)
or different islet cell types (**Figure 3D**).
