## What are immortalized cell lines?

**Immortalized cell lines** are cells from a multicellular organism which continuously proliferate due to an introduced mutation
that allow them to bypass normal stages of the cell cycle (which would normally prevent indefinite cell growth). These cell lines
are useful tools in scientific research to model different diseases/cancers, because unlike primary cells, they grow rapidly and
can be easily used in different experimental designs. However, because these cell lines contain mutations, they often differ
from their non-immortalized cellular origins. 

## Case study: Pancreatic islet cell lines vs. primary islet cells

In 2017, my colleagues and I performed a comparative study of mouse pancreatic islet cell lines and primary islet cells to determine
how similar their respective genomic profiles were. We examined the epigenomes and transcriptomes of primary beta and alpha islet cells
as well as those of beta-TC6/BTC6 (beta cell line) and alpha-TC1/aTC1 (alpha cell line) cells (**see Panel A below**). In our study, 
we observed that beta-TC6 and alpha-TC1 cell open chromatin landscapes were unique at classical alpha cell transcription factors
(_Arx_, see **Panel B**) and beta cell (_Pdx1_, see **Panel C**) factors. This suggested that the cell line open chromatin profiles
resembled those of primary cells at these classic cell-specific loci.

However, when looking at the transcriptomes of these cell lines, and those of primary islet cells (publicly available data from 
_Blodgett et al. 2015, Ackermann et al. 2016, and DiGruccio et al. 2016_), we observed that the alpha-TC1/aTC1 cell transcriptomes were 
different from those primary human and mouse alpha cells, whereas the beta-TC6/bTC6 cell transcriptomes seemed to resemble those of
their primary mouse beta cell counterparts (**see Figure below**).
