title: About me
---

* Currently work as a **Bioinformatician / Research Data Analyst** for [The Jackson Laboratory](https://www.jax.org). I'm located at the Farmington, CT campus where I collaborate closely with [Michael Stitzel](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-stitzel-lab) and [Duygu Ucar](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-ucar-lab).

* I obtained my Professional Science Master's in **Microbial Systems Analysis** under the supervision of [Joerg Graf](https://mcb.uconn.edu/joerg-graf/) from [The University of Connecticut](https://psm.uconn.edu) and my Bachelor of Science in **Biology** from [Boston College](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/biology.html). My master's project involved developing an R package ([_multiClust_](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4907340/)) to identify gene expression patterns in cancer microarray data associated with patient clinical outcome. 

* I enjoy mining and integrating big datasets (especially next-generation sequencing data, e.g., RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, Hi-C, ChIA-PET) to study a wide range of topics including type 2 diabetes, aging, and immune system development.
